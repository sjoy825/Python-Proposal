Note:
Please excuse the length of our video. Due to the nature of the game (dying and restarting) and the large map we created in an effort to make an actual scary and detailed game, we had to go over time in order to show a general overview.

Overall:
Our project idea was very ambitious from the beginning. We knew from the start that we wanted to win best project so we needed a good idea, some humor, and a lot of time. Given the time constraint, we are proud of our final project! We accomplished our main goals: we designed a haunted house maze that includes a “monster” chasing the player in a scary, school environment where they are confronted by things like no advisor appointments, job applications, and newbie freshamn. We even went the step further (mentioned in our proposal submission) and decorated the interior and walls with additional designs. 

Difficulties:
We faced many MANY obstacles. We orginally wanted to create the game in Unreal Engine, but spent days trying to get it working on our computer. Once it was downloaded, it crashed our computer every time it launched so we had to figure out Unity.
We learned that it takes often 2-3 months to build a video game, which is bad news for two non-gamers and new programmers. We had to get creative when we realized it how long it took to create characters and so we focused on the essentials while incorporating much of our theme through design. We chose to design posters on Canva and import them to hang throughout the school. This was the perfect touch to make sure our idea shined through.
We learned that Unity 6 is relatively new so it was impossible to find a full tutorial to follow on Youtube to help us build game. We ended up watching many tutorials that taught us the small things, like how to create a working door. We also received feedback and assitance from our gamer friend Cody. While he had no programming experience, he knew a lot about how games should work and helped us plan our game in a way that made it flow (his name makes it on one of the posters in the game).
We spent countless hours doing research, meeting up in person, finding time for zoom calls, understanding C#, and clearing error codes. This was a real challenge as we are two accoutning majors that are taking 18 credits and one of us works 20+ hours a week as well.
Given more time, we would have loved to make the enemy look even scarier but we stuggled with code. We decided to make him as scary as possible by creating our own material for him.

What we learned/enjoyed:
We learned that like many things in life, programming takes a lot of patience. There were many times where we almost quit and were prepared to send you an email asking you for a new assignment. Our final project is the fourth one because we had to keep starting over. When everything finally started coming together, we were beyond proud of ourselves. Perserverance is key. Teammwork is key. 
It got us involved with our friends and talking to our family. People were intrigued to know that we were building a game from scratch and wanted to offer their own "cool ideas". We didn't realize that video games can bring people together since most people isolate themselves when playing. We have a feeling that this will be one of the things we talk about throughout our lives. We know that it is not something many new programmers are able to accomplish (or that's what Google said).
Programming is cool.
Building a game from scratch is even cooler.
