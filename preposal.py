# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Idea 1:
- A Haunted maze game based on things that are scary for college students
- Includes: Exam due dates, networking events, group projects, etc. You must
    find the exit of the game before you are caught by the Final Exam Monster

Idea 2:
- Tower defense game
- Includes: People that are scary for college student coming towards the tower
    like profesors, freshman, dean, political canvasers, advisors, etc.
    Each person will have a different defense strength that's inflicted if
    they reach the tower. To stop them, they must be shot away with pens.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not just yet. Maybe when we start creating the project, I'll have some questions.
